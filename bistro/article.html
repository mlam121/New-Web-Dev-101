<h2>Low and Slow</h2>

<p>
This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called
<I>sous vide</I>. In sous vide cooking, <dfn>you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
plastic) into a water bath that is <b>precisely</b> set to the target temperature you want
the food to be cooked to.</dfn> In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it
as 
<q><em>ultra-low-temperature</em> poaching.</q>

<p><br>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To
reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us <b>before</b> <time>November 30</time>.<br></p>
