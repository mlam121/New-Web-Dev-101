<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique
called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you
submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath
that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter
describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>
